Finals for BIOS 703
----------------------------------------

* What are the conditions necessary for evolution by natural selection to occur?
* Apart from natural selection, what else can account for changes in gene frequencies within a population over time?
* Explain how a balanced sex ratio (50% males, 50% females) arises from frequency-dependent selection.
* Give examples from 3 different medical disciplines of diseases that are  likely due to a novel environment.
* Give 3 examples of evolutionary adaptations of many cancer cells and how they improve the fitness of cancer cells.

* There are hundreds of different cell types in the human body. Explain how this can be, given that all somatic cells share the same genomic code.
* Explain the concepts of negative and positive feedback using examples from the endocrine system.
* Describe the signaling transduction pathway of a typical mammalian growth factor leading to synthesis of new proteins necessary for cell growth and division.
* How do neurons transmit signals over long distances?
* It is estimated that 60 billion cells die in your body everyday. What are the cell types that have the most rapid turnover? What is the implication for chemotherapy?

* Define replication, transcription and translation.
* Explain what a codon is and its relationship with a frame shift mutation.
* What do the DNA ligase, topoisomerase and primase do in the process of DNA replication?
* What are mobile genetic elements? Give an example and describe its contribution to human disease if any.
* Explain how the quantity/function of a protein can be affected by regulation at the genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional and translational levels.

* Why is the B lymphocyte considered part of the adaptive immune system and the macrophage part of the innate immune system?
* Suppose you have a cut on your skin. Describe the response of the immune system over the first 24-48 hours.
* Sketch graphs of antibody response over time for the first and second vaccinations with the same antigen.
* In a solid organ transplant, there is often a host-versus-graft response that might lead to rejection. In bone marrow transplantation, there may, in contrast, be a graft-versus-host response. Explain why these different responses occur in these situations.
* What is the difference between a tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigen? Which would be likely to be more effective for developing a cancer vaccine and why?

* Explain the hurdles a cancer cell must cross in order to establish a metastasis.
* List 3 hallmarks of cancer and give a specific adaptation of cancer cells for each hallmark.
* What is a tumor microenvironment and how does the microenvironment help or hinder the growth and dissemination of cancer cells?
* Describe what oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are, and give an example of each.
* Explain how a cancer might evolve to be resistant to an anti-cancer drug.

* Give an example of a disease pathogen from each of the following class's: Virus,
Bacteria, Parasite, Fungus and Macroparasite.
* Under Paul Ewalds' model for the evolution of virulence, would a water-borne pathogen be more deadly in a region with poor or good sanitation? Why?
* Suggest public health measures that could limit the development and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
* Why is it almost impossible to eradicate HIV in an infected individual even after effective drug therapy for years?
* What is the human microbiome? Give an example of how it might have medical significance.
